Using absolute paths to the files within your workflowr project makes it difficult for you and others to run your code on a different machine. Change the absolute path(s) below to the suggested relative path(s) to make your code more reproducible.

Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.
</p>
<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version <a href="https://github.com/lukeholman/Methylation_Apis/tree/7f984dcbe5e5111f3d4a9d494d3059e5279be531" target="_blank">7f984dc</a>. See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:

<p>The following sections show the results of statistical tests using <a href="https://github.com/BrendelGroup/BWASP">BWASP</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BrendelGroup/BWASPR">BWASPR</a>. The tables below shows a list of A) CpG sites, or B) 500bp genomic windows, which were statistically significantly differentially methylated (using Fisher Exact tests implemented via <code>methylKit::calculateDiffMeth</code>). Using BWASPR, we specified a series of pre-planned comparions (contrasts) to compare the methylation levels at each site A) between castes within each time point (e.g. queen vs worker samples at 8h), and B) between time points within each caste (e.g. 2h vs 8h within the queen samples). The three tables in each section show sites/windows that were significantly differenetially methylated between castes (at a given time point), or between time points (within each caste).</p>
<p>We caution that this approach of splitting the data into pairwise comparisons is under-powered, because it ignores the rest of the data when estimating each effect size. For example, to test for differential methylation in the ‘2h vs 6h queen’ comparison, the test ignores all data from worker samples, or from the other time points in queens, which does not fully utilise the information in the dataset. The Fisher Exact test approach is also problematic because we have to run 24 separate hypothesis tests for each site (to calculate each of the 24 pairwise comparisons we examined), instead of running one model per site as in the generalised additive models presented below. The <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-values below are corrected using the qvalue method (<code>?qvalue::qvalue</code>) within each comparison, and we identified candidate differentially methylated sites as those for which the <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>-value was &lt;0.05 (or &lt;0.01, in one case where tens of thousands of sites had qvalues just under 0.05).</p>
<p>Despite the issues with the Fisher Exact test approach, we include it for completeness and to facilitate comparison with earlier work.</p>

The table shows the 138 sites for which BWASP reported a significant difference in methylation between time points in queen-destined larvae. Other columns give statistical results and annotations for the focal site. Sites were recorded as statistically significant if both their <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> values were <span class="math inline">\(&lt;0.01\)</span> (note: this is lower than for the previous two tables; there would be 25223 sites if we used the same <span class="math inline">\(&lt;0.05\)</span> cutoff for significance). Note: if we use the same cutoff as before, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(p&lt;0.05\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(q&lt;0.05\)</span>, there would be 25223 significant sites in this table. We therefore switched to <span class="math inline">\(q &lt; 0.01\)</span> for this table, yielding a more manageable number of sites to display.</p>

TeX fonts only; see
http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/configuration.html.  This will make
the presentation more consistent at the cost of the webpage sometimes
taking slightly longer to load. Note that this only works because the
footer is added to webpages before the MathJax javascript. -->
