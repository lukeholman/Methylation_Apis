Using absolute paths to the files within your workflowr project makes it difficult for you and others to run your code on a different machine. Change the absolute path(s) below to the suggested relative path(s) to make your code more reproducible.

Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.
</p>
<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version <a href="https://github.com/lukeholman/Methylation_Apis/tree/e8b99a12d1f5995c602c6542a3b7ff2767d8c3c0" target="_blank">e8b99a1</a>. See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:

<h3>Animation showing the shifting distribution</h3>
<p>The animation shows the distribution of % methylation for all CpG sites of the specified type. Because the majority of CpG sites have no methylation in this species, we have truncated the y-axis so that the right tail of the distribution is visible. To obtain the data underlying this figure, we summed up the number of methylated and unmethylated sequencing reads for each site, across the four replicate samples for each caste/time combination, then found the % methylated reads. The histograms display the frequency in each of 101 bins, for QDL (red) and WDL (blue).</p>

<p>The following uses the results of the GLMs generated below, which estimates the difference in mean % methylation for QDL and WDL at each time point, for each site (as well as the standard error associated with this difference in means). These can be thought of as effect sizes, which describe the effect of caste on methylation at each site.</p>
<p>In this section, we analyse those effect sizes using a linear model, in order to estimate the average effect size for sites of each type. This was accomplished by running a linear model with the following formula:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[y_i = \alpha + \beta_1x_{1i} + \beta_1x_{2i} + \beta_1x_{3i} + \beta_1x_{4i} + \beta_1x_{5i} + \epsilon_i\]</span> Here, <span class="math inline">\(y_i\)</span> is the effect size for site <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is the global intercept, the five <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> terms are regression coefficients to be estimated, the five <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> terms are binary predictor variables for site <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_i\)</span> is the residual (assumed to follow a Normal distribution). The five binary predictor variables describe whether the focal site is (or is not) in a coding region, a promoter, an intron, a 5’-UTR, or a 3’-UTR respectively; note that any one site can overlap more than one of these genomic features. Promoter regions were defined as regions that are up to 2000bp upstream or 200bp downstream of a gene. After fitting the model, we then used the estimated regression coefficients to find the estimated average effect size for a site that maps uniquely to each one of the five genomic features. One model was run for each time point (i.e. one model for each of the figure panels below).</p>

<h3>Heatmap showing similarities between samples and genes</h3>
<p>The heatmap shows data on the CpG sites that were measured with at least 5x coverage in all 36 samples. The version on the first tab is restricted to sites with an avearge methylation frequency of at least 75% (n = 39993 sites), while the second tab shows the data for all the methylated sites (i.e. all sites with a mean methylation frequency &gt;2.7%; n = 110626 sites). We chose to split the data this way in light of the evidence in teh animation above that the greatest caste difference in methylation frequency was found among sites with high levels of methylation.</p>
<p>Before plotting, the data on each site was scaled to mean zero and unit standard deviation. Next, we removed batch effects (i.e. the variance due to replicates A-D) using <code>sva::ComBat()</code>. Additionally, because it is technically challenging to plot a heatmap with many thousands of rows/columns, we first clustered the sites into 100 groups of sites using k-means clustering (see <code>?pheatmap</code>).</p>
<p>In the figures, the orange colour indicates that the focal sample has a methylation frequency above the average for that group of CpG sites, while purple indicates a below-average methylation frequency. The heatmap highlights that the QDL and WDL samples cluster together quite well, especially for the later time points. This indicates that QDL and WDL have disctinct methylomes, and became more distinct a few hours post-grafting.</p>

<h2>Results of the BWASP differential methylation pipeline</h2>
<p>The following sections show the results of statistical tests using the BWASP pipeline. The table shows a list of sites or 500bp genomic windows that were statistically significantly differentially methylated (using Fisher Exact tests implemented via <code>methylKit::calculateDiffMeth</code>). Using BWASP, we specified a series of pre-planned comparions (contrasts) to compare the methylation levels at each site A) between castes witin each time point (e.g. queen vs worker samples at 8h), and B) between time points within each caste (e.g. 2h vs 8h within the queen samples). The three tables in each section show sites/windows that were significantly differenetially methylated between castes (at a given time point), or between time points (within each caste).</p>
<p>We caution that the Fisher Exact test approach is under-powered because it ignores the rest of the data when estimating each effect size. For example, to test for differential methylation in the ‘2h vs 6h queen’ comparison, the test ignores all data from worker samples, or from the other time points in queens, which does not fully utilise the information in the dataset. The Fisher Exact test appraoch is also problematic because we have to run 24 separate hypothesis tests for each site (to calculate each of the 24 pairwise comparisons we examined), instead of running one model per site as in the generalised additive models presented below. The p-values below are corrected using the qvalue method (<code>?qvalue::qvalue</code>) within each comparison, and we identified candidate differentially methylated sites as those for which the q-value was &lt;0.05 (or &lt;0.01, in one case where tens of thousands of sites had qvalues just under 0.05).</p>
<p>Despite the issues with the Fisher Exact test approach, we include it to facilitate comparison with earlier work.</p>

<strong>Table XX:</strong> The table shows the 112 sites for which BWASP reported a significant difference in methylation between time points in queen-destined larvae. Other columns give statistical results and annotations for the focal site. Sites were recorded as statistically significant if both their <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> values were &lt;0.05.</p>

<h4>Temporally varying methylation (workers)</h4>
<p>Note: if we use the same cutoff as before, i.e. p &lt; 0.05 and q &lt; 0.05, there would be 25223 significant sites in this table. We therefore switched to <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> &lt; 0.01 for this table, yielding a more manageable number of sites to display.</p>

<h3>Count the number of sites before and after QC</h3>
<p>We first remove sites with methylation levels too low for analysis, or which were measured in too few samples, and count up the number of sites suitable for analysis.</p>
<p>The bisulphite conversion rate was about 99.73 (as measured by the apparent % methylation of sites in the phage lambda DNA), so we expect unmethylated sites to appear methylated about 0.27% of the time. To ensure we focus on sites where these ‘false positive’ signals of methylation provide only a modest portion of the observed % of Cs vs Ts (i.e. the estimate of % methylation), we chose to focus on sites that have 10<span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> higher methylation rates than expected based on the low-level background ‘noise’. That is, we excluded all sites where fewer than 2.7% of the reads were Cs (i.e. putatively methylated). This rules out the great majority of sites for which at least one C was observed. We also discarded sites that had been measured in fewer than 32 of our 36 samples.</p>

<h3>Run one GLM per site using <code>base::glm()</code></h3>
<p>There are too many CpG sites to use the Bayesian approaches used elsewhere in this study in a reasonable amount of time. We therefore applied the equivalent frequentist generalised linear model, implemented using <code>base::glm()</code>.</p>
<p>To summarise the following code:</p>
<ul>
<li>These GLMs include all the samples except the four time zero samples. These samples were ommited because they do not neatly belong to either the queen- or worker-destined treatments, making it complicated to include in the model.</li>
<li>Non-linear effects of <code>Time</code> were modeled using a quadratic term, allowing accelerating or deccelerating changes in % methylation with time</li>
<li>For each site, we fit 6 different GLMs that we considered to be biologically plausible, and then performed model averaging based on their Akaike weights using <code>MuMIn::model.avg()</code>. All 6 models contained experimental block as a fixed effect, and optionally also contained the fixed effects time, time^2, the caste:time interaction, and the I(time^2):caste. Note that we did not fit the main effect of caste, which forces queens and workers to have the same % methylation estimate at time zero (which we know must be the case due to the experimental design)</li>
<li>The response variable was the number of cytosines observed at the site, given the total coverage at the sites (i.e. number of reads containing Cs plus Ts). We used Binomial errors and a logit link.</li>
<li>After fitting the models and averaging them, we predicted the % methylation of the site in queens and workers at each time point, and calculated the caste difference, its 95% CIs, and the p-value for the null hypothesis that the caste difference was zero using bootstrapping.</li>
<li>Sites were re-analysed using the Bayesian models if A) the p-value for the caste difference was p &lt; 0.00001 at one or more time points in this GLM analysis, and/or B) the site was statistically significant in the BWASP results mentioned above (FDR-corrected p-value of &lt;0.05).</li>

The Bayesian approach is more flexible, e.g. it allows us to incorporate the time 0 samples into the analysis, facilitates calculation of 95% credible intervals for metrics of interest, and facilitates regularization of the parameter estimates using so-called ‘skeptical’ priors (see the book/lecture series <em>Statistical Rethinking</em> by Richard McElreath).</p>
<p>We first generated multiple copies of the original dataset in which the time 0 samples were relabelled as either a queen or worker. We generated all possible combinations of caste labels in which approximately equal numbers of queen and worker labels were applied to the time 0 samples; for example, if there were data on all four t0 samples for the focal site (the typical situation for most of the sites in our post-QC dataset), we relabelled the t0 samples 6 different ways as follows: QQWW, QWQW, QWWQ, WQQW, WQWQ, WWQQ. We then ran a Bayesian GAM on each of these six datasets, and then averaged their parameter estimates by combining their posteriors using the <code>brm_multiple</code> function in <code>brms</code>. This procedure will tend to push the estimate of % methylation at time zero towards the same value for both castes (which we know <em>a priori</em> must be the case due to our experimental design), by effectively making each t0 sample affect the parameter estimates for both queens and workers (but without duplicating any data, which would falsely inflate the model’s precision).</p>
<p>Each model had the same formula, namely:</p>
<p><code>Binomial(number_methylated, Coverage) ~ caste:time + I(time^2) + I(time^2):caste + replicate</code></p>
<p>That is, the response variable is the number of putatively methylated cytosines observed (i.e. sequencing reads that contain a C rather than a T, in the BiS-seq data) recorded, over a series of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> Bernoulli trials where <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the coverage of the site. The model formula contains time as a continuous predictor, and caste, a 2-level factor. The effect of time is modelled using a thin plate spline smoothing term, i.e. this model is a Bayesian generalised additive model (GAM). We allowed for caste-specific changes in methylation over time by including the smoothing term to differ between castes. We used mildly regularising priors for all fixed effects, namely <code>normal(0, 5)</code>, which helps to prevent overfitting. Replicate (i.e. the 4 experimental blocks) was treated as a fixed factor.</p>
<p>After running the model, we use the posterior parameter estimates to calculate posterior predictions of the mean % methylation at each point in time (using <code>fitted.brmsfit()</code>), in each caste. From these, we can calculate the caste difference in methylation at each time point, and test whether the 95% credible interval of this difference includes zero (implying a significant difference in means). We also calculate the difference between all possible pairs of time points within each caste.</p>

<h4>List of statistically significant sites</h4>
<p><strong>Table SX:</strong> The table shows the list of sites that show statistically significant differential methylation between castes and/or time points, as measured by the Bayesian generalised additive models. The criterion for significance was that the posterior estimates of the difference between a pair of means (e.g. the means for QDL and WDL at a given time point) excluded zero with 99.99% probability or better (similar to a one-tailed p-value of p &lt; 0.0001; the table displays 1 minus this posterior probability, for comparison with p-values). The other columns show the annotations for the focal site, and the full names of any genes for those annotations.</p>

<h2>Plots of estimated % methylation per site</h2>
<p>The following plots show the 3340 CpG sites that showed a highly statistically significant difference between castes and/or time points (defined as a proportion of at least <span class="math inline">\((1- 10^{-8})\)</span> posterior probability of the differences in caste-specific means lies to one side of zero, for one or more time points).

<!-- ## Upset plots of differentially methylated genes -->
<!-- These plots are similar to Venn diagrams, but they can display overlaps between many more categories. The horizontal bar plot in the lower left shows the number of genes that contain 1 or more significantly differentially methylated sites, for a given pairwise comparison. The vertical bars showing the number of these genes that fall into each set intersection.  -->
<!-- The two analytical approaches tell a slightly different story. The Bayesian GAM approach finds more genes that were significantly differentially methylated in multiple comparisons, because it fits a model to the full dataset, while the BWASP approach finds fewer such intersections because it compares each part of the dataset in isolation from the rest. The BWASP approach identifies many differences in methylation between earlier and later time points in workers, while the Bayesian GAM additionally identifies caste differences at later time points (due to a difference in statistical power; the two analyses gives qualitatively similar results). -->

<h2>Correlations in difference in % methylation for each comparison</h2>
<p>To test whether the caste-specific sites differed because of changes in the queen methylome, the worker methylome, or both, we estimated the Spearman correlations between the 3 effect sizes per site (estimated using GAMs), namely the effect sizes measuring the change in % methylation between 8h QDL and 8h WDL, between 8h QDL and 2h QDL, and between 8h WDL and 2h WDL.</p>
<p>We found that the difference between 8h QDL and 8h WDL was positively correlated with the change from 2-8h in QDL, indicating that part of the 8h caste difference reflected changes in QDL. Moreover, we found that the difference between 8h WDL and 2h WDL was negatively correlated with the change from 2-8h in QDL, suggesting that the 8h caste difference was also due to changes in WDL.</p>

<!-- ## Correlations in difference in % methylation for each comparison  -->
<!-- Classifying sites as significant and non-significant, then making a Venn diagram or UpSet plot, is potentially problematic because A) statistical significance is arbitrary, and B) the results are strongly affected by statistical power (which is generally low in genome-wide analyses), complicating interpretation. To provide a complementary visualisation to the UpSet plots that addresses this issue, we here search for correlations in the estimated difference in % methylation that were estimated for each comparison shown in the above UpSet plots. For example, if we found that sites whose % methylation increased (or decreased) with time in workers also tended to be differentially methylated between queens and workers at later time points, we might infer that the focal sites are (de)methylated in workers (but not queens) over the course of development. -->

<h2>GO and KEGG enrichment of genes showing variable methylation</h2>
<p>The results in the following plots were calculated using GSEA tests for enrichment, implemented in the <code>fgsea</code> package. This test involves ranking genes by some statistic and then searching for GO and KEGG terms that are over-represented among genes at the top or bottom of the list. Here, we ranked the genes by the average of the difference in % methylation between ‘classes’ that was estimated for all the sites in the gene (defined as sites inside the exons, introns, or promoter regions of the gene). ‘Classes’ either means queens and workers (measured at the same time point), or different time points (measured in the same caste). We derive these estimates by model averaging across the five frequentist GAMs that were run on each of the 113,084 sites for which sufficiant data were available.</p>
<p>The output of <code>fgsea</code> includes the “normalised enrichment score” (NES) which describes how much the pathway is over-represented at the top of this list (for positive NES), or over-represented at the bottom (negative NES), and there is an associated <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-value for each NES (calculated by resampling).</p>

<h3>Enrichment results for genes showing <strong>caste differences</strong> in methylation</h3>
<p>Red means that there is higher % methylation for genes annotated with the focal pathway/process in queens, while blue means higher % methylation in workers. A single asterisk indicates statistically significant enrichment, and a double asterisk indicates that this significant result remained after Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate correction (which is overly conservative here, since these multiple tests are not independent).</p>

<h3>Enrichment results for genes showing <strong>temporal changes</strong> in methylation</h3>
<p>Orange means that the temporal change in % methylation was comparatively large and positive for genes annotated with the focal pathway/process, while purple means the change in % methylation was comparatively large and negative. A single asterisk indicates statistically significant enrichment, and a double asterisk indicates that this significant result remained after Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate correction (which is overly conservative here, since these multiple tests are not independent).</p>

<div id="fit-bayesian-model-to-the-eigengene-estimates" class="section level3">
<h3>Fit Bayesian model to the eigengene estimates</h3>
<p>The following code chunk fits a Bayesian model to the eigenegene estimates produced by <code>WGCNA</code>. The ‘eigengene’ for sample <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, module <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>, gives a measure of the expression level of all the coexpressed genes that were assigned to module <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>, for sample <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> relative to other samples. The eigengenes were transformed to have a mean of zero and standard deviation of 1 prior to analysis.</p>
<p>Because the module eigengenes are somewhat correlated with each other, it is valuable to run a single model of all <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> module eigengenes (thereby using the information in this correlation), rather than running <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> univariate models. We therefore ran a single multivariate model encompassing all 9 modules (including module zero, the unassigned genes).</p>
<p>Furthermore, we expected <em>a priori</em> that some eigengenes will change non-linearly, for example increasing to a plateau, or increasing then decreasing again, throughout the course of development (as observed in the Bayesian GAMs above for individual methylated sites). We therefore used the same Bayesian GAM approach to model the eigengenes. Specifically, the time effect was modelled using a thin plate spline with basis dimension k=4, to allow for a non-linear time effect; the smooth used was allowed to differ between queens and workers, allowing for caste-specific change over time. As before, we ran the model on different versions of the data where the t0 samples were labelled as either queens or workers in each possible balanced combination then combined the posterior parameter estimates; this procedure forces the intercept at time zero to be the same for each caste.</p>
<p>In <code>brms</code> notations (which is similar to e.g. the <code>lme4</code> and <code>mgcv</code> R packages), the model formula for each module is written as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ y \sim caste + s(time, by = caste, k = 4) + replicate\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> is the eigengene for module <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>.</p>

<h3>Calculate effect sizes for the module eigengenes</h3>
<p><strong>Table SX:</strong> The table shows a summary of the posterior estimate of the difference in mean module eigengenes between queen- and worker-destined larvae at each of the four time points. In short, all modules except 3 and 5 showed some evidence for a difference in eigengenes between castes, which indicates caste differences in suites of co-methylated sites. The difference between castes was clearest for modules 1 and 6 (both p &lt; 0.0001). The estimates are derived from the posterior estimates for a Bayesian multivariate generalised additive mixed model where the response variable for each sample was a length-9 vector of eigengenes for the 9 modules. The model allowed for caste-specific, non-linear changes in module eigengenes over time (see Figure XXX), and fit “Replicate” as a random intercept. The eigengenes were mean-centred and scaled to unit variance, so the units in the ‘Caste difference’ column can be interpreted as the standardised effect size (Cohen’s <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>). Other columns show the mean deviation of data points from the estimated mean, the 95% credible interval for the mean, and the posterior probability that the true effect size has the opposite sign to the first column (similar to a one-tailed <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-value).</p>

<!-- ### Test for overlap between the co-expression and co-methylation modules -->
<!-- Very few pairs of modules from the co-expression network and the co-methylation network overlapped significantly, suggesting either that suites of co-methylated genes are not necessarily co-expressed, or that uncertainty in the estimation of both networks makes such a relationship difficult to detect. The exception was Module 1 in the co-methylation network, which overlapped significantly with Modules 0 and 18 in the co-expression network (using hypergeometric tests with p-values corrected for multiple testing). -->
