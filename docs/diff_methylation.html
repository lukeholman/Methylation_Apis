Using absolute paths to the files within your workflowr project makes it difficult for you and others to run your code on a different machine. Change the absolute path(s) below to the suggested relative path(s) to make your code more reproducible.

Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.
</p>
<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version <a href="https://github.com/lukeholman/Methylation_Apis/tree/03f41db6297947177719198c3cba601e00667efc" target="_blank">03f41db</a>. See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:

<h3>Animation showing the shifting distribution</h3>
<p>The animation shows the distribution of % methylation for all CpG sites of the specified type. Because the majority of CpG sites have no methylation in this species, we have truncated the y-axis so that the right tail of the distribution is visible. To obtain the data underlying this figure, we summed up the number of methylated and unmethylated sequencing reads for each site, across the four replicate samples for each caste/time combination, then found the % methylated reads. The histograms display the frequency in each of 101 bins, for QDL (red) and WDL (blue).</p>

<h2 class="tabset">Genomic context of sites with caste-specific methylation</h2>
<p>The following uses the results of the GLMs generated below, which estimates the difference in mean % methylation for QDL and WDL at each time point, for each site (as well as the standard error associated with this difference in means). These can be thought of as effect sizes, which describe the effect of caste on methylation at each site.</p>
<p>In this section, we analyse those effect sizes using a linear model, in order to estimate the average effect size for sites of each type. This was accomplished by running a linear model with the following formula:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[y_i = \alpha + \beta_1x_{1i} + \beta_1x_{2i} + \beta_1x_{3i} + \beta_1x_{4i} + \beta_1x_{5i} + \epsilon_i\]</span> Here, <span class="math inline">\(y_i\)</span> is the effect size for site <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is the global intercept, the five <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> terms are regression coefficients to be estimated, the five <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> terms are binary predictor variables for site <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_i\)</span> is the residual (assumed to follow a Normal distribution). The five binary predictor variables describe whether the focal site is (or is not) in a coding region, a promoter, an intron, a 5’-UTR, or a 3’-UTR respectively; note that any one site can overlap more than one of these genomic features. Promoter regions were defined as regions that are up to 2000bp upstream or 200bp downstream of a gene. After fitting the model, we then used the estimated regression coefficients to find the estimated average effect size for a site that maps uniquely to each one of the five genomic features. One model was run for each time point (i.e. one model for each of the figure panels below).</p>

<h3 class="tabset">Heatmap showing similarities between samples and genes</h3>
<p>The heatmap shows data on the CpG sites that were measured with at least 5x coverage in all 36 samples. The version on the first tab is restricted to sites with an avearge methylation frequency of at least 75% (n = 39993 sites), while the second tab shows the data for all the methylated sites (i.e. all sites with a mean methylation frequency &gt;2.7%; n = 110626 sites). We chose to split the data this way in light of the evidence in the animation above that the greatest caste difference in methylation frequency was found among sites with high levels of methylation.</p>
<p>Before plotting, the data on each site was scaled to mean zero and unit standard deviation. Next, we removed batch effects (i.e. the variance due to replicates A-D) using <code>sva::ComBat()</code>. Additionally, because it is technically challenging to plot a heatmap with many thousands of rows/columns, we first clustered the sites into 100 groups of sites using k-means clustering (see <code>?pheatmap</code>).</p>
<p>In the figures, the orange colour indicates that the focal sample has a methylation frequency above the average for that group of CpG sites, while purple indicates a below-average methylation frequency. The heatmap highlights that the QDL and WDL samples cluster together quite well, especially for the later time points. This indicates that QDL and WDL have disctinct methylomes, and became more distinct a few hours post-grafting.</p>

<h3>Count the number of sites before and after QC</h3>
<p>We first remove sites with methylation levels too low for analysis, or which were measured in too few samples, and count up the number of sites suitable for analysis.</p>
<p>The bisulphite conversion rate was about 99.73 (as measured by the apparent % methylation of sites in the phage lambda DNA), so we expect unmethylated sites to appear methylated about 0.27% of the time. To ensure we focus on sites where these ‘false positive’ signals of methylation provide only a modest portion of the observed % of Cs vs Ts (i.e. the estimate of % methylation), we chose to focus on sites that have 10<span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> higher methylation rates than expected based on the low-level background ‘noise’. That is, we excluded all sites where fewer than 2.7% of the reads were Cs (i.e. putatively methylated). This rules out the great majority of sites for which at least one C was observed. We also discarded sites that had been measured in fewer than 32 of our 36 samples.</p>

<h3>Run one GLM per site using <code>base::glm()</code></h3>
<p>Here, we analyse the 113044 methylated sites for which we have sufficient data using one generalised linear model per site, via the function <code>base::glm()</code>.</p>
<p>To summarise the following code:</p>
<ul>
<li>These GLMs include all 36 samples where possible. Samples were omitted when the focal site was covered by &lt;4 reads in the focal sample.</li>
<li>Non-linear effects of <code>Time</code> were modeled using a quadratic term, allowing accelerating or deccelerating changes in % methylation with time</li>
<li>For each site, we fit 6 different GLMs that we considered to be biologically plausible, and then performed model averaging based on their Akaike weights using <code>MuMIn::model.avg()</code>. All 6 models contained experimental block (<code>rep</code> in the models below) as a fixed effect, and optionally also contained the fixed effects <code>time</code>, <code>time^2</code>, the <code>caste:time</code> interaction, and the <code>I(time^2):caste</code> interaction. Note that we did not fit caste as predictor except in interactions with <code>time</code>, which forces queens and workers to have the same estimated % methylation at time zero (which we know must be the case due to our experimental design)</li>
<li>The response variable was the number of cytosines observed at the site, given the total coverage at the sites (i.e. number of reads containing Cs plus Ts). We used Binomial errors and a logit link.</li>
<li>After fitting the models and averaging them, we predicted the % methylation of the site in queens and workers at each time point, and calculated the caste difference, its 95% CIs, and the p-value for the null hypothesis that the caste difference was zero using bootstrapping.</li>
<li>We also saved the p-value for <code>caste:time</code> or <code>I(time^2):caste</code> (whichever was greater) from the top-ranked model, using the <code>car::Anova()</code> function to run a likelihood ratio test. We use this to score the ‘significance’ of caste for each site, and this value is presented in the table of results below (-log10 transformed)</li>

<h4>Sites showing significant differential methylation</h4>
<p>We label a CpG site as significantly differentially methylated between castes/timepoints if the effect of caste (as measured by the best-fitting model) was <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> &lt; 0.0001 (n = 1668 sites). Not all sites survived false discovery rate correction; those that did are labelled with an asterisk the table below (we include both since the false discovery rate correction is overly conservative here, since these tests are not independent due to correlations in methylation between sites) (n = 368 sites were signficant after FDR correction). The table shows the location of each significant site, and mentioned if it is found in parts of one or more genes.</p>

<h2>Correlations in difference in % methylation for each comparison</h2>
<p>To test whether the caste-specific sites differed because of changes in the queen methylome, the worker methylome, or both, we estimated the Spearman correlations between the 3 effect sizes per site (estimated using GLMs), namely the effect sizes measuring the change in % methylation between 8h QDL and 8h WDL, between 8h QDL and 0h QDL, and between 8h WDL and 0h WDL.</p>
<p>We found that the difference between 8h QDL and 8h WDL was positively correlated with the change from 0-8h in QDL, indicating that part of the 8h caste difference reflected changes in QDL. Moreover, we found that the difference between 8h WDL and 0h WDL was negatively correlated with the change from 0-8h in QDL, suggesting that the 8h caste difference was also due to changes in WDL.</p>

<h2>Plot genomic locations of (caste-specific) methylation</h2>
<p><strong>Figure</strong>: The following plot shows that DNA methylation is found all 16 of the largest contigs (putative chromosomes), and that sites showing caste-specific methylation are widely distributed across the methylome. The solid black line shows the density of sites with &gt;50% DNA methylation, which closely correlates with the density of genes (shown by the dashed black line). The purple line shows the density of sites that we identified as having significant caste-specific methylation (<span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> &lt; 0.0001), which also follows the overall distribution of genes with few exceptions. The coloured rug plot at the bottom marks methylated sites (grey) and differentially methylated sites (red: QDL-biased, and blue: WDL-biased).</p>

<h2>GO and KEGG enrichment of genes showing variable methylation</h2>
<p>The results in the following plots were calculated using GSEA tests for enrichment, implemented in the <code>fgsea</code> package. This test involves ranking genes by some statistic and then searching for GO and KEGG terms that are over-represented among genes at the top or bottom of the list. Here, we ranked the genes by the average of the difference in % methylation between ‘classes’ that was estimated for all the sites in the gene (defined as sites inside the exons, introns, or promoter regions of the gene). ‘Classes’ either means queens and workers (measured at the 8h time point), or the 0h and 8h time points (measured in either queens or workers). We derive these estimates by model averaging GLMs that were run on each of the 113084 sites for which sufficient data were available.</p>
<p>The output of <code>fgsea</code> includes the “normalised enrichment score” (NES) which describes how much the pathway is over-represented at the top of this list (for positive NES), or over-represented at the bottom (negative NES), and there is an associated <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-value for each NES (calculated by resampling).</p>

<h3>Enrichment results for genes showing <strong>caste differences</strong> in methylation</h3>
<p>Red means that there is higher % methylation for genes annotated with the focal pathway/process in queens, while blue means higher % methylation in workers. A single asterisk indicates statistically significant enrichment, and a double asterisk indicates that this significant result remained after Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate correction (which is overly conservative here, since these multiple tests are not independent).</p>

<h3>Enrichment results for genes showing <strong>temporal changes</strong> in methylation</h3>
<p>Orange means that the temporal change in % methylation was comparatively large and positive for genes annotated with the focal pathway/process, while purple means the change in % methylation was comparatively large and negative. A single asterisk indicates statistically significant enrichment, and a double asterisk indicates that this significant result remained after Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate correction (which is overly conservative here, since these multiple tests are not independent).</p>

<h3>Fit Bayesian model to the eigengene estimates</h3>
<p>The following code chunk fits a Bayesian multivariate model to the eigengene estimates from the co-methylation network produced by <code>WGCNA</code>. The ‘eigengene’ for sample <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, module <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>, gives a measure of the methylation level of all the co-methylated genes that were assigned to module <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>, for sample <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> relative to other samples. The eigengenes were transformed to have a mean of zero and standard deviation of 1 prior to analysis.</p>
<p>Because the module eigengenes are somewhat correlated with each other, it is valuable to run a single model of all <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> module eigengenes (thereby using the information in this correlation), rather than running <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> univariate models. We therefore ran a single multivariate model encompassing all 9 modules (including module zero, the unassigned genes).</p>
<p>Furthermore, we expected <em>a priori</em> that some eigengenes will change non-linearly, for example by increasing to a plateau. We therefore used the same quadratic formula (implemented with `brms’) to model the eigengenes, to allow for a non-linear (and potentially caste-specific) time effect. As before, we ran the model on different versions of the data where the <span class="math inline">\(t_0\)</span> samples were labeled as either queens or workers in each possible balanced combination then combined the posterior parameter estimates; this procedure ensures that the <span class="math inline">\(t_0\)</span> samples have an equal effect on the predicted values for queens and workers. Note that the main effect of caste is again missing from the model, which forces the queen and worker samples to have the same value at <span class="math inline">\(t_0\)</span></p>
<p>In <code>brms</code> notations (which is similar to e.g. the <code>lme4</code> and <code>mgcv</code> R packages), the model formula for each module is written as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ y \sim Caste:Time + I(Time^2) + I(Time^2):Caste + Replicate\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> is the eigengene for module <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>.</p>

<h3>Calculate effect sizes for the module eigengenes</h3>
<p><strong>Table S8:</strong> The table shows a summary of the posterior estimate of the difference in mean module eigengenes between QDL and WDL at each of the four time points. There was a difference between castes in module eigengenes for modules 1 and 5 (both p &lt; 0.0001), suggesting that close to 2,000 co-methylated genes acquired caste-specific methylation profiles in the first 8h post-grafting. The estimates are derived from the posterior estimates for a Bayesian multivariate generalised additive mixed model where the response variable for each sample was a length-9 vector of eigengenes for the 9 modules. The model allowed for caste-specific, non-linear changes in module eigengenes over time (see Figure 4B), and adjusted for Replicate. The eigengenes were mean-centred and scaled to unit variance, so the units in the ‘Caste difference’ column can be interpreted as the standardised effect size (Cohen’s <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>). Other columns show the mean deviation of data points from the estimated mean, the 95% credible interval for the mean, and the posterior probability that the true effect size has the opposite sign to the first column (similar to a one-tailed <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-value).</p>

<!-- ### Test for overlap between the co-expression and co-methylation modules -->
<!-- Very few pairs of modules from the co-expression network and the co-methylation network overlapped significantly, suggesting either that suites of co-methylated genes are not necessarily co-expressed, or that uncertainty in the estimation of both networks makes such a relationship difficult to detect. The exception was Module 1 in the co-methylation network, which overlapped significantly with Modules 0 and 18 in the co-expression network (using hypergeometric tests with p-values corrected for multiple testing). -->
