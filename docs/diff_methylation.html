Using absolute paths to the files within your workflowr project makes it difficult for you and others to run your code on a different machine. Change the absolute path(s) below to the suggested relative path(s) to make your code more reproducible.

Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.
</p>
<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version <a href="https://github.com/lukeholman/Methylation_Apis/tree/8400c490a6747c191bb6da128db6f4414aaa79f7" target="_blank">8400c49</a>. See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:
</p>
<pre><code>
Ignored files:
    Ignored:    .DS_Store
    Ignored:    .Rapp.history
    Ignored:    .Rproj.user/

Unstaged changes:
    Modified:   analysis/diff_methylation.Rmd

<p>
Note that any generated files, e.g. HTML, png, CSS, etc., are not included in this status report because it is ok for generated content to have uncommitted changes.

<h2>Genomic context of sites with caste-specific methylation</h2>
<p>The following plots show estimates of the average difference in methylation between castes (within a timepoint) or timepoints (within a caste). These plots use the output of the BWASP pipelinee, which (among other things) uses the <code>methylkit</code> package to estimate the difference in % methylated cytosines at a given site between two groups of samples. This difference in % methylated cytosines is the (unstandardised) effect size. We then used a linear model to estimate the average effect size for sites of each genomic context privded in the .gff file of genome annotations (e.g. exons, introns, UTRs). This was accomplished by running a linear model with the following formula:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[y_i = \alpha + \beta_1x_{1i} + \beta_1x_{2i} + \beta_1x_{3i} + \beta_1x_{4i} + \beta_1x_{5i} + \epsilon_i\]</span> Here, <span class="math inline">\(y_i\)</span> is the effect size for site <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is the global intercept, the five <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> terms are regression coefficients to be estimated, the five <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> terms are binary predictor variables for site <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_i\)</span> is the residual (assumed to be sampled from a Normal distribution with mean zero). The five binary predictor variables describe whether the focal site is (or is not) in a coding region, a promoter, an intron, a 5’-UTR, or a 3’-UTR (note that sites can be overlap more than one of these). Promoter regions were defined as regions that are within 2000bb upstream or 200bp downstream of a gene. After fitting the model, we then used the estimated regression coefficients to find the estimated average effect size for sites that mapped uniquely to each of the five genomic features. One model was run for each comparison point (i.e. each panel in the figures below).</p>

<h2>Results of the BWASP differential methylation pipeline</h2>
<p>The following sections show the results of statistical tests using the BWASP pipeline. The table shows a list of sites or 500bp genomic windows that were statistically significantly differentially methylated (using Fisher Exact tests implemented via <code>methylKit::calculateDiffMeth</code>). Using BWASP, we specified a series of pre-planned comparions (contrasts) to compare the methylation levels at each site A) between castes witin each time point (e.g. queen vs worker samples at 8h), and B) between time points within each caste (e.g. 2h vs 8h within the queen samples). The three tables in each section show sites/windows that were significantly differenetially methylated between castes (at a given time point), or between time points (within each caste).</p>
<p>We caution that the Fisher Exact test approach is under-powered because it ignores the rest of the data when estimating each effect size. For example, to test for differential methylation in the ‘2h vs 6h queen’ comparison, the test ignores all data from worker samples, or from the other time points in queens, which does not fully utilise the information in the dataset. The Fisher Exact test appraoch is also problematic because we have to run 24 separate hypothesis tests for each site (to calculate each of the 24 pairwise comparisons we examined), instead of running one model per site as in the generalised additive models presented below. The p-values below are corrected using the qvalue method (<code>?qvalue::qvalue</code>) within each comparison, and we identified candidate differentially methylated sites as those for which the q-value was &lt;0.05 (or &lt;0.01, in one case where tens of thousands of sites had qvalues just under 0.05).</p>
<p>Despite the issues with the Fisher Exact test approach, we include it to facilitate comparison with earlier work.</p>

<strong>Table XX:</strong> The table shows the 112 sites for which BWASP reported a significant difference in methylation between time points in queen-destined larvae. Other columns give statistical results and annotations for the focal site. Sites were recorded as statistically significant if both their <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> values were &lt;0.05.</p>

<h4>Temporally varying methylation (workers)</h4>
<p>Note: if we use the same cutoff as before, i.e. p &lt; 0.05 and q &lt; 0.05, there would be 25223 significant sites in this table. We therefore switched to <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> &lt; 0.01 for this table, yielding a more manageable number of sites to display.</p>

<h3>Count the number of sites before and after QC</h3>
<p>We first remove sites with methylation levels too low for analysis, or which were measured in too few samples, and count up the number of sites suitable for analysis.</p>
<p>The bisulphite conversion rate was about 99.73 (as measured by the apparent % methylation of sites in the phage lambda DNA), so we expect unmethylated sites to appear methylated about 0.27% of the time. To ensure we focus on sites where these ‘false positive’ signals of methylation provide only a modest portion of the observed % of Cs vs Ts (i.e. the estimate of % methylation), we chose to focus on sites that have 10<span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> higher methylation rates than expected based on the low-level background ‘noise’. That is, we excluded all sites where fewer than 2.7% of the reads were Cs (i.e. putatively methylated). This rules out the great majority of sites for which at least one C was observed. We also discarded sites that had been measured in fewer than 32 of our 36 samples.</p>

<h3>Run preliminary frequentist GAMs using <code>mgcv::gam</code></h3>
<p>There are too many sites to run our preferred Bayesian model on all of them in a reasonable amount of time. We therefore first use a model selection approach using the equivalent frequentist generalised additive model (GAMs; implemented in the <code>mgcv</code> package, which runs a similar model in &lt;1 second) to select a set of sites that appear to show a caste difference in the frequency of methylation, which we then re-analyse using the slower (but more principled and information-rich) Bayesian approach. To summarise the following code:</p>
<ul>
<li>The frequentist analysis uses all samples except the time zero samples, since these are complicated to model correctly because they do not neatly belong to either the queen- or worker-destined treatments</li>
<li><code>Time</code> is modelled using a thin plate regression spline (see <code>?mgcv::s</code>), allowing non-linear changes in % methylation with time, with the amount of non-linearity being driven by the data.</li>
<li>For each site, we fit 5 different models and then compare them using the corrected Akaike Information Criterion (AICc). The 5 models fitted included the following fixed effects: 1) neither caste nor time (our ‘null model’), 2) caste, 3) time, 4) both caste and time, or 5) caste, time, and their interaction (the ‘full model’). Additionally, all these models contained the experimental replicate as a fixed effect.</li>
<li>The formula of the full model was therefore same as for the Bayesian models run below, i.e. <code>caste + s(time, by = caste, k = 4) + rep</code>.</li>
<li>The response variable was the number of cytosines observed at the site, given the total coverage at the sites (i.e. number of reads containing Cs plus Ts). We used Binomial errors and a logit link.</li>
<li>Sites were re-analysed using the Bayesian models if A) the ‘variable importance’ of caste was at least 99% (indicating that there is &gt;99% chance that caste is present in the top model out of the 5 that were considered), and/or B) the site was statistically significant in the BWASP results mentioned above.</li>

<h3>Run the Bayesian GAMs</h3>
<p>The previous code chunk identified 2630 candidate differentially-methylated sites, which we now analyse using a Bayesian generalised additive model (GAM). The Bayesian approach is more flexible, e.g. it allows us to incorporate the time 0 samples into the analysis, facilitates calculation of 95% credible intervals for metrics of interest, and facilitates regularization of the parameter estimates using so-called ‘sceptical’ priors (see the book/lecture series <em>Statistical Rethinking</em> by Richard McElreath).</p>
<p>We first generated multiple copies of the orignal dataset in which the time 0 samples were relabelled as either a queen or worker. We generated all possible combinations of caste labels in which approximately equal numbers of queen and worker labels were applied to the time 0 samples; for example, if there were data on all four t0 samples for the focal site (the typical situation for most of the sites in our post-QC dataset), we relabelled the t0 samples 6 different ways as follows: QQWW, QWQW, QWWQ, WQQW, WQWQ, WWQQ. We then ran a Bayesian GAM on each of these six datasets, and then averaged their parameter estimates by combining their posteriors using the <code>brm_multiple</code> function in <code>brms</code>. This procedure will tend to push the estimate of % methylation at time zero towards the same value for both castes (which we know <em>a priori</em> must be the case due to our experimental design), by effectively making each t0 sample affect the parameter estimates for both queens and workers (but without duplicating any data, which would falsely inflate the model’s precision).</p>
<p>Each model had the same formula, namely:</p>
<p><code>Binomial(number_methylated, Coverage) ~ caste + s(time, by = caste, k = 4) + replicate</code></p>
<p>That is, the response variable is the number of putatively methylated cytosines observed (i.e. sequencing reads that contain a C rather than a T, in the BiS-seq data) recorded, over a series of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> Bernoulli trials where <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the coverage of the site. The model formula contains time as a continuous predictor, and caste, a 2-level factor. The effect of time is modelled using a thin plate spline smoothing term, i.e. this model is a Bayesian generalised additive model (GAM). We allowed for caste-specific changes in methylation over time by including the smoothing term to differ between castes. We used mildly regularising priors for all fixed effects, namely <code>normal(0, 5)</code>, which helps to prevent overfitting. Replicate (i.e. the 4 experimental blocks) was treated as a fixed factor.</p>
<p>After running the model, we use the posterior parameter estimates to calculate posterior predictions of the mean % methylation at each point in time (using <code>fitted.brmsfit()</code>), in each caste. From these, we can calculate the caste difference in methylation at each time point, and test whether the 95% credible interval of this difference includes zero (implying a significant difference in means). We also calculate the difference between all possible pairs of time points within each caste.</p>
<p>The following runs the models in parallel using <code>future_lapply</code>, and we attempt to save time by not recompiling the model between each site.

<h3>Identifying “significant” sites</h3>
<p>We label a site as significantly differentially methylated between castes/timepoints if the posterior estimate of the difference in mean methylation between castes/timepoints excludes zero with over 95% probability (after applying Benjamini-Hochberg correction to control the false discovery rate). We chose this definition in an attempt to balance the risk of false positives and false negatives.</p>

<h2>Plots of estimated % methylation per site</h2>
<p>The following plots show the 2474 CpG sites that showed a statistically significant difference between castes and/or time points. The total number of sites tested was 2630. Of these, 2378 were differentially methylated between castes, 900 showed significant temporal variation in queens, and 1022 showed significant temporal variation in workers.</p>
<p>The plot below shows 16 of the 2474 significant sites; click the tabs to see the remainder. The red colour refers to queens, blue to workers.</p>

<h3>Reduce and plot the methylomes using NMDS</h3>
<p>Here, we construct a sample-by-site matrix where each cell contains the proportion of methylated cytosines (i.e. those with a mean % methylation of 2.7% or higher), containing all 110626 sites that were measured with 5x or better coverage in all 36 samples. We then reduce the data to 16 components by non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS), preserving 43% of the variance in the original data.</p>

<h3>Heatmap showing similarities between samples and genes</h3>
<p>The heatmap shows data on the CpG sites that were measured with at least 5x coverage in all 36 samples. The version on the first tab is restricted to sites with an avearge methylation frequency of at least 75% (n = 39993 sites), while the second tab shows the data for all the methylated sites (i.e. all sites with a mean methylation frequency &gt;2.7%; n = 110626 sites). We chose to split the data this way in light of the earlier evidence that the greatest caste difference in methylation frequency was found among sites with high levels of methylation.</p>
<p>Before plotting, the data on each site was scaled to mean zero and unit standard deviation. Next, we removed the effect of replicate (i.e. reps A-D) using <code>sva::ComBat()</code> to highlight the biologically interesting patterns in the data. Additionally, because it is not possible to plot the heatmap for tens of thousands of sites, we first clustered the sites into 100 groups of sites using k-means clustering (see <code>?pheatmap</code>).</p>
<p>In the figures, the orange colour indicates that a group of sites has a methylation frequency above the average for that site, while purple indicates a below-average methylation frequency.</p>

<h2>Upset plots of differentially methylated genes</h2>
<p>These plots are similar to Venn diagrams, but they can display overlaps between many more categories. The horizontal bar plot in the lower left shows the number of genes that contain 1 or mroe significantly differentially methylated sites. The vertical bars showing the number of these genes that fall into each set intersection. For brevity, we only plot insections that contain two or more genes (there are a many extra sets containing a single gene that are not shown).</p>
<p>The two analytical approaches tell a slightly different story. The Bayesian GAM approach finds more genes that were significantly differentially methylated in multiple comparisons, because it fits a model to the full dataset, while the BWASP approach finds fewer such intersections because it compares each part of the dataset in isolation from the rest. The BWASP approach identifies many differences in methylation ebtween earlier and later time points in workers, while the Bayesian GAM additionally identifies caste differences at later time points (due to a difference in statistical power; the two analyses gives qualitatively similar results).</p>

<!-- ## Correlations in difference in % methylation for each comparison  -->
<!-- Classifying sites as significant and non-significant, then making a Venn diagram or UpSet plot, is potentially problematic because A) statistical significance is arbitrary, and B) the results are strongly affected by statistical power (which is generally low in genome-wide analyses), complicating interpretation. To provide a complementary visualisation to the UpSet plots that addresses this issue, we here search for correlations in the estimated difference in % methylation that were estimated for each comparison shown in the above UpSet plots. For example, if we found that sites whose % methylation increased (or decreased) with time in workers also tended to be differentially methylated between queens and workers at later time points, we might infer that the focal sites are (de)methylated in workers (but not queens) over the course of development. -->

<h2>GO and KEGG enrichment of genes showing variable methylation</h2>
<p>The following uses GSEA tests for enrichment, implemented in the <code>fgsea</code> package. This test involves ranking genes by some statistic and then searching for GO and KEGG terms that are over-represented among genes at the top or bottom of the list. Here, we ranked the genes by the weighted average of the difference in % methylation between ‘classes’ that was estimated for all the sites in the gene (defined as sites that are inside the exons or promoter region of the gene). ‘Classes’ either means queens and workers (measured at the same time point), or different time points (measured in the same caste). The output is a “normalised enrichment score” (NES) which describes how much the pathway is over-represented at the top of this list (for positive NES) or underrepresented (negative NES), and there is an associated <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-value.</p>

<p>Red means that there is higher % methylation for genes annotated with the focal pathway/process in queens, while blue means higher % methylation in workers. A single asterisk indicates statistically significant enrichment, and a double asterisk indicates that this significant result remained after Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate correction (which is overly conservative here, since these multiple tests are not independent). The few missing squares relate to cases where not enough genes were successfully measured that were annotated with the focal GO term (we required a minimum of 5 genes).</p>

<h3>Fit Bayesian model to the eigengene estimates</h3>
<p>The following code chunk fits a Bayesian model to the eigenegene estimates produced by <code>WGCNA</code>. The ‘eigengene’ for sample <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, module <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>, gives a measure of the expression level of all the coexpressed genes that were assigned to module <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>, for sample <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> relative to other samples. The eigengenes were transformed to have a mean of zero and standard deviation of 1 prior to analysis.</p>
<p>Because the module eigengenes are somewhat correlated with each other, it is valuable to run a single model of all <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> module eigengenes (thereby using the information in this correlation), rather than running <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> univariate models. We therefore ran a single multivariate model encompassing all 9 modules (including module zero, the unassigned genes).</p>
<p>Furthermore, we expected <em>a priori</em> that some eigengenes will change non-linearly, for example increasing to a plateau, or increasing then decreasing again, throughout the course of development (as observed in the Bayesian GAMs above for individual methylated sites). We therefore used the same Bayesian GAM approach to model the eigengenes. Specifically, the time effect was modelled using a thin plate spline with basis dimension k=4, to allow for a non-linear time effect; the smooth used was allowed to differ between queens and workers, allowing for caste-specific change over time. As before, we ran the model on different versions of the data where the t0 samples were labelled as either queens or workers in each possible balanced combination then combined the posterior parameter estimates; this procedure forces the intercept at time zero to be the same for each caste.</p>
<p>In <code>brms</code> notations (which is similar to e.g. the <code>lme4</code> and <code>mgcv</code> R packages), the model formula for each module is written as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ y \sim caste + s(time, by = caste, k = 4) + replicate\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> is the eigengene for module <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>.</p>

<h3>Calculate effect sizes for the module eigengenes</h3>
<p><strong>Table SX:</strong> The table shows a summary of the posterior estimate of the difference in mean module eigengenes between queen- and worker-destined larvae at each of the four time points. In short, all modules except 3 and 5 showed some evidence for a difference in eigengenes between castes, which indicates caste differences in suites of co-methylated sites. The difference between castes was clearest for modules 1 and 6 (both p &lt; 0.0001). The estimates are derived from the posterior estimates for a Bayesian multivariate generalised additive mixed model where the response variable for each sample was a length-9 vector of eigengenes for the 9 modules. The model allowed for caste-specific, non-linear changes in module eigengenes over time (see Figure XXX), and fit “Replicate” as a random intercept. The eigengenes were mean-centred and scaled to unit variance, so the units in the ‘Caste difference’ column can be interpreted as the standardised effect size (Cohen’s <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>). Other columns show the mean deviation of data points from the estimated mean, the 95% credible interval for the mean, and the posterior probability that the true effect size has the opposite sign to the first column (similar to a one-tailed <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-value).</p>

<!-- ### Test for overlap between the co-expression and co-methylation modules -->
<!-- Very few pairs of modules from the co-expression network and the co-methylation network overlapped significantly, suggesting either that suites of co-methylated genes are not necessarily co-expressed, or that uncertainty in the estimation of both networks makes such a relationship difficult to detect. The exception was Module 1 in the co-methylation network, which overlapped significantly with Modules 0 and 18 in the co-expression network (using hypergeometric tests with p-values corrected for multiple testing). -->
