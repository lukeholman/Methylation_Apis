Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.
</p>
<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version <a href="https://github.com/lukeholman/Methylation_Apis/tree/885b3f714c363d67543abfdd239edaf68a83f6c9" target="_blank">885b3f7</a>. See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:
</p>

Note that any generated files, e.g. HTML, png, CSS, etc., are not included in this status report because it is ok for generated content to have uncommitted changes.

<h3>Fit Bayesian model to the eigengene estimates</h3>
<p>The following code chunk fits a Bayesian model to the eigenegene estimates produced by <code>WGCNA</code>. The ‘eigengene’ for sample <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, module <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>, gives a measure of the expression level of all the coexpressed genes that were assigned to module <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>, for sample <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> relative to other samples. The eigengenes were transformed to have a mean of zero and standard deviation of 1 prior to analysis.</p>
<p>Because the module eigengenes are somewhat correlated with each other, it is valuable to run a single model of all <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> module eigengenes (thereby using the information in this correlation), rather than running <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> univariate models. We therefore ran a single multivariate model encompassing all 0 modules (including module zero, the unassigned genes).</p>
<p>Furthermore, we expected a prior that some eigengenes will change non-linearly, for example increasing to a plateau, or increasing then decreasing again, throughout the course of development. We therefore fit the time effect using a thin plate regression line smooth (i.e. we used a generalised additive model) with basis dimension k=4, to allow for a non-linear time effect. To allow for a caste-specific change over time, we fit one smooth for the reference caste (queens), and fit a ‘difference smooth’ for the other caste to allow it to deviate.</p>
<p>Finally, our experiment was split into 4 replicates/blocks, and so we fit replicate as a random effect to account for similarity in eigengenes between samples measured in the same block, and prevent pseuodreplication.</p>
<p>In <code>brms</code> notations (which is similar to e.g. <code>lme4</code> and many other R packages), the model formula for each module is written as</p>

<h3>Calculate effect sizes for the module eigengenes</h3>
<p><strong>Table SX:</strong> The table shows a summary of the posterior estimate of the difference in mean module eigengenes between queen- and worker-destined larvae at each of the four time points. The estimates are derived from the posterior estimates for a Bayesian multivariate generalised additive mixed model where the response variable for each sample was a length-0 vector of eigengenes for the 0 modules. The model allowed for caste-specific, non-linear changes in module eigengenes over time (see Figure XXX), and fit “Replicate” as a random intercept. The eigengenes were mean-centred and scaled to unit variance, so the units in the ‘Caste difference’ column can be interpreted as the standardised effect size (Cohen’s <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>). Other columns show the mean deviation of data points from the estimated mean, the 95% credible interval for the mean, and the posterior probability that the true effect size has the opposite sign to the first column (similar to a one-tailed <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-value).</p>

<p><br></br> <strong>Figure 4</strong>: Results of KEGG pathway enrichment analysis for the genes in each of the three significantly pheromone-sensitive transcriptional modules. The gene universe was defined as all genes for which we found an ortholog in all four species (i.e. the set that was used to discover these co-expressed modules). All KEGG terms shown in green were significantly enriched (p &lt; 0.05), and those shown in purple remained significant after correction for multiple testing. Fold enrichment was calculated as the proportion of genes associated with the focal KEGG term in the module, divided by the equivalent proportion in the gene universe.</p>
